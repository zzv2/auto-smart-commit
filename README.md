## Auto Jira smart commit

This [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook transforms your Git commit messages into [Jira smart commits](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/using-smart-commits-960155400.html).

If your branch name contains a [Jira issue key](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/changing-the-project-key-format-861253229.html) such as `ABC-123`, the hook will automatically format your commit message into a Jira smart commit:

If the branch name does not contain a Jira issue key, the commit message is not modified. The time logged takes into account non-working hours such as lunch breaks and nights.

See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for an explanation of the seven rules of a great Git commit message:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line (automated)
4. Do not end the subject line with a period (automated)
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
